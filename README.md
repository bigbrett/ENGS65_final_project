# ASTEROIDS: a console application
### Created by Brett Nicholas and Daniel Berman 
### ENGS65 15W Professor Eugene Santos

A game based off of the original Atari game Asteroids. 

Requires SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries in addition to standard C++ libraries.

Code successfully runs and compiles on MacOSX using Xcode 6. NOTE: in Globals.h, the file path must be changed to the full path
where the .ttf file in the media folder is located, as Xcode puts the executable elsewhere. For normal builds, the pathname currently in use will work if the media folder is in the same folder as the .exe

SDL code was largely based on code provided in tutorials found at http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php

Algorithms for drawing the ship and asteroids were based on drawing algorithms found in code at https://github.com/LanceJZ/SDL2VectorAsteroids
